# CreateSpamDomainFilter
Used domains of spam emails to create block filters

I used ChatGPT and the Gmail App Script documentation to come up with a way to help reduce my spam.

Loop through all of spam messages.

Get Email Address

Get Domain Name of Email Address

Create Filter to Move To Trash any domains with that email address.

Future Goals:
1. Once Gmail Allows it to report phishing automatically for all spam emails
2. Allow creation and sharing of list of domains we can all share and import to prevent alot more spam from hitting everyone
