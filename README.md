# CreateSpamDomainFilter.js
Gmail App Script as a scheduled task to automatically block all spam emails and domain names.

Logic of Filter:
1. Check for all emails in the spam folder
2. Get both the from email address and it's domain name
3. Create New Filter to block all emails from both.
4. Move email to trash

Help:
ChatGPT and other tutorials helped me identify the syntax for my dream of a more automated spam fighter. So I appreciated the help.

Future Ideas:
1. Global Spam List - To help us all block more spam
2. Send Data to Spam Reporting Sites - To reduce amount of spam
